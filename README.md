## **Developer Setup**

### **Prerequisites**

Ensure you have Node.js 18+ installed.

npm install  
cp .env.example .env.local  
\# Set NEXT\_PUBLIC\_SITE\_URL to your public URL (see SEO below)

### **Development**

Launch a local development server:

npm run dev

Open [http://localhost:3000](https://www.google.com/search?q=http://localhost:3000) to view your stack.

### **Production Build**

To prepare the application for a production environment:

npm run build  
npm start

*Note: For static exports, add output: 'export' to next.config.ts. Note that dynamic OG images require a server-side runtime.*

## **Performance & Optimization**

Designed with a "Brooklyn Studio" aesthetic and an obsessed focus on PageSpeed:

* **Zero Render-Blocking Icons:** The hero rocket is an inline SVG, eliminating the need for heavy external font files.  
* **Optimized Typography:** Uses the Inter variable font via next/font for minimal layout shift (CLS).  
* **Edge-Ready Motion:** All animations (floating rocket, space-time warp) are compositor-friendly, utilizing only transform and opacity for 60fps performance on mobile.  
* **Critical CSS:** Leverages experimental.inlineCss to remove render-blocking CSS requests.

## **SEO & Social Unfurls**

The app is pre-configured for perfect social sharing:

1. **Metadata Base:** Set NEXT\_PUBLIC\_SITE\_URL to drive canonical URLs and absolute image paths.  
2. **Dynamic Preview Cards:** Branded 1200×630 OG and Twitter images are generated automatically.  
3. **Structured Data:** Includes JSON-LD for **WebSite**, **WebPage**, and **SoftwareApplication** to maximize search engine visibility.
